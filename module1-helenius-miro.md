# Cisco Endpoint Security Module 1 

## Types of Cyber Threaths 

- Software Attacks
    - Denial-of-service (dos) attack.
    - Computer virues
      
- Software Errors
    - Sofware bugs
    - Appliations going offline
    - Cross-site-scripts or illegal file server share
      
- Sabotage
    - Unauthorized user gets access/penetrates companys primary dataase.
    - Defacement of an organization's website.
      
- Human Error
    - firewall misconfiguration
    - Inadvertent data entry errors
    
- Theft
    - Laptops, computers or other equipment being stolen
      
- Hardware Failures
   - Hard drive crashes
     
- Utility Interuption
   - Eletrical power outages
   - Water damage resulting from sprinkler failure etc. 
     
- Natural Disasters
    - Stroms, hurricanes and tornadoes
    - Earthquakes
    - Floods
    - Fires
 

## Internal vs External Threats 

Threats can be Internal (Inside Job) or external 

Internal: 
- Current or former employees
- Other Contract Partners
- Trusted partners

These threats can be mishandling of confidential data accidentally or intentionally. These threats can be also connecting infected media to servers or devices and or accessing malicious emails or websites. 

  External: 
  - Organized attackers
      - Hacktivists
      - Terrorist
      - State-sponsored

  - Hackers
     - Black hats
     - Grey hats
     - White hats

  - Amateurs

External atackers can exploit vulnerabilities in network devices or use social engineering techniques to gain access to an organization's internal resources. 

Internal threat is more potential to cause more serious damage. Current workers have direct access to companys premises and infrastructure devices. They also have inside info of organizations network, resources and confidential data. 

## User Threats and Vulnerabilities 

User domain - includes anyone with access to organization's information, system. Users are considered to be the weakest link in information security systems, posing a significant threat to CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and availability) of organizations data. 


Most common user threats:

- No awareness of security
- Poorly enforces security policies
- Data theft
- Unauthorized downloads and media
- Unauthorized virtual private networks (VPNs)
- Unauthorized websites
- Destruction of systems, applications or data


## Threats to Devices 

- Any device left powered on and without supervision is a risk for unauthorized person to gain access to network resources
- Suscpicious files, music, media, photos, or videos pose a risk for execution of malicious code on a device.
- Security vulnerabilities are regularly exploited by cyber criminals within organization's devices to launch attacks
- Information security teams must constantly keep up with evolving risks and exploits.
- Unauthorized USB, CD or DVD pose a risk for malicious softwares.
- POLICIES are in place for a reason. Their main goal is to protect organization's IT infrastructure.
- Outdated hardware is more prone to attacks.

## Threats to Local Area Network

Potential threats to LAN include: 
- Unauthorized access to premises, wiring closets, data centers and computer rooms
- Unauthorized access to systems, applications and data. (eg, computer left open)
- Rogue user gaining access to wireless networks
- Exploiting data in transit (man in the middle)
- Many different operating system (eg Different LAN servers) harder to manage many devices with different settings
- Network probing and port scanning
- Misconfiguration of firewalls (allows unauthorized access) from outside or inside


## Threats to the Private Cloud '

Private cloud includes single organizations resources, eg private servers, resources and IT infrastructure.

While private cloud feels more secure, it is still vulnerable to certain exploits and attacks.

- Network probing and port scanning
- Unatuhorized access to recources
- Vulnerabilities in network devices, routers, firewalls or other network devices or software vulnerabilities
- Configuration errors in network devices
- Remote users may access company's data and download sensitive data if there is exploits


## Threats to the Public Cloud

Public Cloud is meant for many different organizations and resources are shared between many different organizations 

Public Cloud Models 
- Software as a Service (Saas) - subscription based model that provides softwares which are centrally hosted to users. These sofwares are accessesd from web browser and they are stored in cloud.
  
- Platform as a Service (Paas) - subscription based model provides a platform that allows developing, running and managing applications on the service's hardware. It is accessed via public cloud.
  
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - subscription based model which provides virtual computing resources. Hardware, software servers, storage and other types of infrastructure components. 

Most common threaths to public cloud are the following: 
- Data breaches
- Loss of theft of intellectual property
- Compromised accounts and passwords
- Social engineering attacsk (phissing etc)
- Compliance violiation

## Threats to Applications 
Application domain includes critical systems, applications and data. These are eng email, security monitoring and database management. These are more frequently hosted from public cloud.

Applications pose significant threats
- Gaining unauthorized access to data centers, computers, wiring closets or systems
- Downtime of servers during maintenance (Cloud provider hosting the services, company cannot use own backup server and so on.)
- Network operatin system sofware vulnerabilities.
- Data loss (third party affecting)
- Vulnerabilities in client-server of web application development
